    <p>This service allows you to create surveys/forms, quizzes, polls. Everything is handled online so you don't need to install any software or host anything on your own webserver.
The final surveys, polls, etc. are delivered as simple web links which you must distribute to your chosen respondents. You can paste this web link onto your facebook page, your website or blog, or use the built in email system</p>

    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <p>The dashboard is where you can access all of your existing projects (surveys, quizzes, forms and polls) as well as create new ones. When you first visit the page it will show all project types. Each item in the list shows the date it was created and the current response count. If you hover your mouse over the item then additional options will be available to view the results, edit, duplicate, clear and delete the project</p>
