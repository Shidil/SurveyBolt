We may choose to offer a reduced rate to students and academics in full time education.  This offer is also extended to educational organisations themselves.  If you are unsure whether you qualify for the discount then please email us and obtain written confirmation. <br><br>

Student accounts should not be used to conduct any kind of commercial research. The student package cannot be used to conduct research intended to be of benefit of a commercial orginisation without the prior written permission of FreeOnlineSurveys.com.

Companies and individuals not in full time education found to be using the student/academic discounted package will be liable to pay a $5000 fine to FreeOnlineSurveys.com.
